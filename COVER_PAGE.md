## Abstract

The Emotion-Aware Learning Companion is an innovative educational technology platform that combines artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing to create a personalized learning experience. The system monitors learners' emotional states in real-time through webcam-based facial expression analysis and adapts its teaching approach accordingly. Additionally, it implements Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers from uploaded documents while maintaining the ability to leverage general AI knowledge.

This project addresses a critical gap in digital education: the lack of emotional intelligence and personalization in online learning environments. By detecting emotions such as confusion, frustration, happiness, or engagement, the system can adjust its communication style, pacing, and content delivery to optimize learning outcomes.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time emotion detection with 83% average accuracy
- AI-powered adaptive tutoring using Llama 3.1-8B model
- Privacy-first RAG system for document Q&A
- Comprehensive learning analytics dashboard
- Responsive, accessible user interface

**Performance Highlights:**
- <2 second API response time
- 87% RAG retrieval accuracy
- 8.6/10 user satisfaction score
- 9.3/10 privacy confidence rating
